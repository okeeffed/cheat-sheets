# D3

This all relates back to "D3 in action". Check back to the book for more info.

## The power of d3

The main power of d3 comes through the ability to select document elements
`d3.selectAll("circle.a").style("fill", "red").attr("cx", 100);`

This takes every circle on our page with the class of "a" and turns it red and moves it so that its center is 100 pixels to the right of the left side of our <svg> canvas.
